The user is looking for an apartment to buy. His criteria is: price has to be 400000 liras or cheaper than that , the apartment has to be 10 years or younger, and it has to have at least 3 rooms. Write a code which takes 3 inputs: price, age and number of rooms and specifies if the input meets the userâ€™s criteria or not.

Enter price, age and the number of rooms > 410000, 11, 5
Price and age are too high

Or

Enter price, age and the number of rooms > 400000, 8, 3
Criteria satisfied
